## Hello World!

This is my first time using Github pages. I'm a student in Web and Mobile Development course in Vancouver. 
Learning about Github and some features.

### History of Web

The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is a global information medium which users can access via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as email and Usenet also do. The history of the Internet dates back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web. 

### Precursors
The hypertext portion of the Web in particular has an intricate intellectual history; notable influences and precursors include Vannevar Bush's Memex,[3] IBM's Generalized Markup Language,[4] and Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu.[3] Paul Otlet's Mundaneum project has also been named as an early 20th-century precursor of the Web.[5]

The concept of a global information system connecting homes is prefigured in "A Logic Named Joe", a 1946 short story by Murray Leinster, in which computer terminals, called "logics", are present in every home. Although the computer system in the story is centralized, the story anticipates a ubiquitous information environment similar to the Web. The cultural impact of the Web was imagined even further back in a short story by E. M. Forster, "The Machine Stops", first published in 1909.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tgbeta/github-pages-test/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
